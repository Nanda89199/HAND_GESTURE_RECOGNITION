HAND GESTURES RECOGNITION LIBRARIES


1. OpenCV (cv2): For capturing and processing video frames from the webcam.
2. MediaPipe (mediapipe): For hand landmark detection and drawing.
3. Pillow (PIL): For converting video frames to Tkinter-compatible images.
4. Tkinter (tkinter): For the GUI (built-in with Python, but we'll note it for clarity).
5. NumPy: Implicitly required by OpenCV and MediaPipe for array operations.
